## 🧩 Concepts Covered

### 🔹 **1. Introduction to Functions**
A **function** is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.  
Functions allow programmers to avoid code repetition and make programs more modular.

### 🔹 2. Function with Parameters
Functions can accept input values (called parameters) and perform operations using them.

### 🔹 3. Function with Return Value
A return statement sends a result back to the caller.

### 🔹 4. Default and Keyword Arguments
Python functions allow default arguments and keyword arguments for flexibility.

### 🔹 5. Function with Loops and Conditionals
Functions often include loops and conditional statements to perform logic-based tasks.
