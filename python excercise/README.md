## 🧩 Topics Covered

### 🔹 **1. Strings**
Strings are sequences of characters used to store and manipulate text.

🟢 Key Points:

- Strings are immutable
- Support slicing and built-in methods like upper(), lower(), replace()

### 🔹 2. Loops
Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times.

🟢 Key Points:

- for loop → iterates over a sequence
- while loop → runs while a condition is true

### 🔹 3. Functions
Functions group reusable code blocks that perform specific tasks.

🟢 Key Points:

- Defined using def
- Improve code reusability and readability

### 🔹 4. Lists
Lists store multiple items in a single variable.

🟢 Key Points:

- Ordered and mutable
- Support operations like append, remove, sort

### 🔹 5. Dictionaries
Dictionaries store data as key–value pairs.

🟢 Key Points:

- Unordered and mutable
- Access elements using keys
