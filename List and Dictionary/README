# 🧠 Python Lists & Dictionaries

### Understanding Core Python Data Structures with Hands-on Examples

---

## 📘 Overview
This project demonstrates the *fundamentals of Lists and Dictionaries in Python* through simple and practical examples.  
It’s perfect for beginners learning how to *store, access, and manipulate data efficiently.*

- *Notebook/File:* List & Dict.ipynb
- *Focus Areas:* Python Basics, Lists, Dictionaries, Loops, and Functions

## 🧩 Topics Covered

### 📂 Lists
Lists are *ordered, mutable collections* used to store multiple items.  
They can hold elements of different data types and support powerful operations.

*Key Points:*
- Defined using [ ]
- Mutable (can be changed)
- Support indexing and slicing
- Common methods: append(), insert(), remove(), pop(), sort()

---

### 🗂️ Dictionaries
Dictionaries store data as *key–value pairs* and are used when each value needs a unique identifier.  
They are *unordered, mutable, and dynamic*.

*Key Points:*
- Defined using { }
- Access values using keys
- Support adding, updating, and deleting key–value pairs
- Common methods: items(), keys(), values()

---

### 🔄 Combined Usage
Lists and Dictionaries can work together to represent structured data.

*Examples:*
```python
students = [
    {"name": "Aarav", "marks": [85, 90, 88]},
    {"name": "Diya", "marks": [78, 82, 89]},
]

for student in students:
    avg = sum(student["marks"]) / len(student["marks"])
    print(f"{student['name']} - Average Marks: {avg}")
