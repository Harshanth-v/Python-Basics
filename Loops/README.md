## 📘 Overview

This project explains the concept of **Loops in Python** using a Jupyter Notebook.  
Loops are one of the most essential parts of programming — they help execute a block of code repeatedly, making programs efficient and dynamic.

📁 **Notebook File:** `Loops.ipynb`  
🧠 **Focus Areas:** For Loops, While Loops, and Control Statements

## 🧩 Concepts Covered

### 🔹 **1. For Loop**
A **for loop** is used to iterate over a sequence such as a list, tuple, or string.

🟢 Key Points:

- Used for iterating through sequences
- Automatically stops after the last element
- Often combined with range() for numeric loops

### 🔹 2. While Loop
A while loop runs as long as a specified condition is True.

🟢 Key Points:

- Continues until condition becomes False
- Needs manual counter updates to avoid infinite loops
- Useful when number of iterations is unknown

### 🔹 3. Control Statements
Control statements help modify the normal flow of loops.

🟢 Key Points:

- break → exits the loop immediately
- continue → skips to the next iteration
- pass → placeholder, does nothing
