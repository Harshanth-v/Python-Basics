1.Explain the difference between a for loop and a while loop. In what scenarios would you prefer to use one over the other?
2.Write a for loop that iterates through a list of integers and prints only the even numbers.
3.Write a while loop that continues to ask the user for a number until they enter a negative number. The loop should print the sum of all entered numbers.
4.Given a list of strings, use a for loop to create a new list containing the lengths of each string.
5.What is the purpose of the break and continue statements in loops? Provide an example of each.
6.Implement a while loop that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number n.
7.Explain how nested for loops work. In what situations are they commonly used?
8.Write a nested for loop to generate a multiplication table (from 1x1 to 10x10).
9.for loops to create a (*) pattern like Pyramid, for a given number n = 6:
10.What is list comprehension? How does it differ from using a for loop to create a list?
11.Use list comprehension to create a list of squares of the first 10 positive integers.
12.Given a list of strings, use list comprehension to create a new list that contains only the strings that have more than 3 characters.
13.Given two lists, one of keys and one of values, use dictionary comprehension to create a dictionary.
14.Write a dictionary comprehension to create a dictionary from a list of numbers, where each key is the number and the value is its square.
15.What is the difference between the break and continue statements? Provide an example of each in a loop.
16.Write a for loop that iterates through a list of numbers. Use the break statement to exit the loop when a number greater than 50 is encountered.
17.Create a while loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 10, but skips the number 5 using the continue statement.
18.Given a list of integers, use a for loop with a break statement to find and print the first negative number in the list. If there are no negative numbers, print "No negative numbers found."
